FcgiStatus
==========

An FCGI version of the Howl plugin (http://github.com/nkallen/howl/tree/master)


Example
=======

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include FcgiStatus

  â€¦ your other code.
end

In top or ps your process will look like:

dispatch.fcgi (1/13m37.00s): last job: YourController#show GET (/bob.xml)

If you would like a custom key in the process list rather than path you can define a method named fcgi_key. Be aware that this method will be called BEFORE the controller action so any fields used must be initialized in previous filter or within the fcgi_key method itself.

class YourController < ApplicationController
  def fcgi_key
    "a=#{@key1} ; b=#{@key2}"
  end
end

Which will produce a process name like:

dispatch.fcgi (1808/13m37.00s): last job: YourController#show GET (a=foo ; b=bar)

WARNING: On many operating systems the process name cannot be changed to a value longer than the original command line. In order to work around this you can add change the #! line of your dispatch.fcgi like so:

#!/usr/bin/ruby -I/non-existent-padding-directory-name  -I/non-existent-padding-directory-name -I/non-existent-padding-directory-name -I/non-existent-padding-directory-name
