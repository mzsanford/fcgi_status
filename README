FcgiStatus
==========

An FCGI version of the Howl plugin (http://github.com/nkallen/howl/tree/master)


Example
=======

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include FcgiStatus

  â€¦ your other code.
end

And, if you would like a custom key in the process list rather than path:

class YourController < ApplicationController
  def fcgi_key
    "a=#{@key1} ; b=#{@key2}"
  end
end
